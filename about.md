I've worked in Cyber Security for around 5 years for two major UK Telcos.

The majority of my time working in cyber has been in 3rd line/CERT type roles as an escalation point for high level incidents, this has also included a lot of threat hunting and in my current role a lot of focus on malware analysis.

I love what I do and think there is real value in sharing knowledge amongst the cyber industry. This is why i decided to setup this site, I will be sharing malware analysis I have conducted along with anything that i think is particluarly cool relating to incident response.
